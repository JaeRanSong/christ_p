        <b>C</b>hristopher Kane, the label, was launched in 2006. It began
        almost immediately upon Kane’s graduation from Central Saint Martins,
        capitalising on the success of his award winning MA collection that had
        already garnered much media attention.<br />

        <br /><b>T</b>he designer has always been acknowledged as both a
        precocious and truly gifted talent. Christopher Kane has quickly matured
        and grown to become one of the powerhouse labels of British fashion with
        one of the biggest international profiles. The catwalk shows, held
        during London Fashion Week, are a widely acknowledged highlight of the
        international fashion calendar.<br />

        <br /><b>D</b>eveloping his highly creative and playful signatures of
        constant innovation, rebellious femininity and extraordinary skill, his
        clothes continue to surprise and seduce with their ineffable sense of
        chic.<br />

        <br /><b>S</b>ince its inception the company has expanded from producing
        bi-annual Womenswear collections into Resort, Menswear, Pre-Fall and a
        full range of Accessories offering (including Handbags and Footwear).<br />

        <br /><b>T</b>he design philosophy of Christopher Kane comes from an
        abstract and personal approach, defined by a mood or a feeling and often
        comprises elements of autobiography, upbringing and simple observations
        of life as well as escapism for Christopher. These elements are combined
        in Christopher’s own drawing process that defines his output as well as
        his extensive technical skill. It all adds up to collections that
        transform the ordinary into the extraordinary: embracing the traditional
        and the modern, the timeless and the ephemeral, the sleek with the
        subversive.<br />

        <br /><b>M</b>eanwhile, Christopher Kane, the designer, has been the
        recipient of many industry accolades and awards including four British
        Fashion Awards – winning Designer of the Year in 2013 – and the
        prestigious Vogue Fashion Fund is perhaps no surprise that Christopher
        Kane came to the attention of Kering (formerly PPR), the French luxury
        goods group that includes Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney,
        Saint Laurent and Balenciaga among its retinue of brands. In January
        2013 it was announced that the group would be investing in the house,
        purchasing a 51 per cent share of the company.<br />
